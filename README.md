## What Is Eclipse?

Eclipse is a proprietary conversational AGI designed for emotionally intelligent, context-adaptive, and ethically governed dialogue. Fine-tuned through Norman-style Transfer Learning, Eclipse operates beyond traditional chatbot behaviorâ€”capable of reasoning, wit, and multi-agent decision-making.

This project is fully integrated with the Rasa CALM Framework, optimized for complex conversations, tone shifts, user emotion recognition, and intelligent fallback handling.
